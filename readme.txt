What Is This?

This mod includes a whole bunch of Discord integration functionality - ranging from a Raid Alarm for players to use, to kill feeds and admin tools for moderators to use.

The raid alarm can be built and managed by players in-game to send Webhook messages to their own Discord channels.

The raid alarm part of this mod was obviously inspired by Daemonforge's Raid Alarm mod, but this mod was built from scratch and does not use any of his code or his Universal API - it's purely standalone.

It comes with some basic chat commands as well - such as "!admin" to send a Discord message to the server's Discord to notify admins of a request for help (or bug report / player report etc), as well as a "!tele X Y" command to teleport the admins to a location on the map.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be installed on both server and client.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io
